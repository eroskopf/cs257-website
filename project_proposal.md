# Team B - Steam Data Website
**Purpose**:
Steam is a video game distribution service for PC games created by Valve in 2003. It hosts and allows users to play a wide variety of games from an online library. Our website uses a public dataset from Steamcharts, a website that displays current video game player data from Steam. More specifically, we will be using Steamcharts data from the years 2012-2021, which has been compiled by Jack Ogozaly on Kaggle in a CSV file, including monthly trends in average players, peak players, gains from previous months, and titles for the top 100 games on Steam. We will allow our users to sort through a more filtered view of this data by letting them choose which filters to sort by (average players, peak players, gains), compare specific games, and choose specific timelines over which to see data from.
 
_Amy's comments: Your reader might not know what Steam is, so a quick explanation would be useful. You might also want to be a bit more specific about what "popularity trends" means -- again, because your reader might not be familiar with Steam._
 
## Summary of Datasets:
- The title of the game
- The month/date the data was recorded
- Gain in user count from prior month
- Gain in users as a percent
- Average number of players by month
- Peak number of players by month
- URL to the gameâ€™s data on Steamcharts
 
_Amy's comments: Since you did not provide the metadata worksheet, I'm lacking information on what the dataset is, who the author is, what the license is, etc. Even if you included this worksheet, including a summary of that information here is a good idea. And as above, assume your audience is not familiar with Steam, and explain things like what a steamchart is, etc._
 
## Audience and Goals:
### Game Developers
- Want to know the general statistics of the games they have developed, as well as those of their competitors (if a game is gaining or losing new players)
- Want to understand general trends in player counts over time for specific games.
 
_Amy's comments: Be a bit more specific here. What statistics? What general trends? What is a "life span" -- is it the amount of time the game is played by at least one player on Steam?_
 
### Players
- Want to know which games had the highest number of players at a given time
- Want to know how many people play of a game they are a fan of
- Want to observe the latest trends (if a game is gaining or losing new players)
 
_Amy's comments: Be more specific here -- what do you mean by "most popular for browsing", and what trends might players be interested in?_
 
### Video Game Journalists
- Collect data concerning the top 100 games to tell which games are popular, i.e. which are declining in average and peak players.
- Used for news reports, education, or simple information gathering about gaming trends.
 
_Amy's comments: It seems like there are multiple user roles here, not just one. "News reports" makes me think that video game journalists might be a potential audience. By "researchers" do you mean academic researchers?_
